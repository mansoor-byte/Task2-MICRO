A To-Do List is a simple and useful Python application that helps users manage their daily tasks. It allows users to add, view, complete, edit, and delete tasks directly from the command line. This basic app helps in improving productivity, organization, and time management by keeping track of what needs to be done.

Key Features:
Add Tasks:

Users can create and add new tasks to the list.

View Tasks:

Displays all the current tasks with their status (Completed or Pending).

Mark as Complete:

Tasks can be marked as complete, and the status will change.

Edit Tasks:

Users can update the name or content of any existing task.

Delete Tasks:

Tasks can be removed from the list when no longer needed.

Simple Menu-Driven Interface:

Easy navigation with a numbered menu in the terminal.

Status Indicators:

Each task shows a checkmark (✓) if complete or a cross (✗) if pending.
